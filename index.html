      <h1>The Elephant Down Under</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="caption">The inspiration for this survey came from <a href="http://www.elephantinthevalley.com/">Elephant in The Valley</a>, a survey that was conducted in Silicon Valley in 2015. It focused on five main areas including: Feedback &amp; Promotion, Inclusion, Unconscious biases, Motherhood, and Harassment &amp; Safety. The Elephant Down Under asks the same questions as the original survey but instead focuses on women in technology in Australia.
